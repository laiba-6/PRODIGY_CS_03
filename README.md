Explanation:
Regular Expressions:

r'[A-Z]' checks for uppercase letters.
r'[a-z]' checks for lowercase letters.
r'\d' checks for digits.
r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]' checks for special characters.

Scoring System:

The password starts with a score of 0.
Each criterion met increases the score by 1.

Feedback and Strength Assessment:

If all criteria are met, the password is "Strong".
If at least 3 criteria are met, the password is "Medium".
If fewer than 3 criteria are met, the password is "Weak".
Feedback is provided to help users improve their passwords.

This is implemented in python in a simple yet effective way to evaluate password strength and provide actionable feedback.
